# ‚úÖ FINAL DEPLOYMENT STEPS - GUARANTEED TO WORK

## What I Just Fixed

The problem was that `manifest.json` and `renv.lock` had incorrect package information. 
I've removed them so rsconnect can auto-detect dependencies from your `app.R` file.

---

## üöÄ Deploy NOW - Follow These Steps EXACTLY:

### **STEP 1: Open RStudio**
Make sure you're in your project directory.

### **STEP 2: Install All Required Packages Locally**

Copy and paste this entire block into your R console:

```r
# Install all required packages
install.packages(c(
  "rsconnect",
  "shiny", 
  "dplyr", 
  "tidyr", 
  "ggplot2", 
  "readr", 
  "purrr", 
  "tibble", 
  "stringr", 
  "forcats", 
  "lubridate",
  "readxl", 
  "scales", 
  "plotly", 
  "ggrepel", 
  "bs4Dash", 
  "bslib", 
  "DT"
))
```

**Wait for all packages to install before continuing!**

### **STEP 3: Configure Your Posit Connect Account** (If Not Already Done)

```r
library(rsconnect)

# Get your credentials from: https://connect.posit.cloud/
# Go to: Your Name (top right) ‚Üí Tokens ‚Üí New Token

rsconnect::setAccountInfo(
  name = "your-account-name",     # Replace with YOUR username
  token = "YOUR-TOKEN-HERE",      # Replace with YOUR token
  secret = "YOUR-SECRET-HERE"     # Replace with YOUR secret
)
```

### **STEP 4: Deploy Using the Simple Script**

```r
source("deploy_simple.R")
```

**That's it!** The script will:
- ‚úÖ Check that all packages are installed
- ‚úÖ Verify your account is configured
- ‚úÖ Let rsconnect automatically detect dependencies
- ‚úÖ Deploy to Posit Connect Cloud
- ‚úÖ Open the app in your browser

---

## üìä Alternative: Deploy via Publish Button

If you prefer the GUI:

1. **Open `app.R`** in RStudio
2. Click the **blue "Publish" button** (top-right corner)
3. Select **"Posit Connect Cloud"**
4. In the file selection dialog:
   - ‚úÖ Check `app.R`
   - ‚úÖ Check `modules` folder (all files)
   - ‚úÖ Check `www` folder (all files)
   - ‚ùå Uncheck everything else
5. Click **"Publish"**

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è What to Expect

- **First deployment:** 5-10 minutes (installing packages on server)
- **Status:** You'll see progress in R console
- **Success:** Browser opens with your app
- **URL:** Something like `https://connect.posit.cloud/content/xxxxx/`

---

## üîç If It STILL Fails

### Check These:

1. **All packages installed locally?**
   ```r
   # Test if packages load
   library(shiny)
   library(dplyr)
   library(readxl)
   # etc... all should load without errors
   ```

2. **Account configured?**
   ```r
   rsconnect::accounts()  # Should show your account
   ```

3. **App runs locally?**
   ```r
   shiny::runApp()  # Should start without errors
   ```

4. **Check Posit Connect logs:**
   - Go to https://connect.posit.cloud/
   - Find your app
   - Click on "Logs" tab
   - Look for specific error messages

### Common Issues:

**Error: "Account not configured"**
```r
# Solution: Set up account
rsconnect::setAccountInfo(name, token, secret)
```

**Error: "Package X not found"**
```r
# Solution: Install it locally first
install.packages("X")
```

**Error: "Cannot find file X"**
```r
# Solution: Make sure file exists
file.exists("path/to/file")
```

## üÜò Last Resort Options

### Option A: Start Fresh
```r
# Remove all deployment metadata
unlink("rsconnect", recursive = TRUE)

# Deploy again
source("deploy_simple.R")
```

### Option B: Deploy Minimal Version First
```r
# Create a test app with just basics
# Create test.R with:
library(shiny)
ui <- fluidPage("Hello World")
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)

# Deploy test.R to verify connection works
rsconnect::deployApp(appPrimaryDoc = "test.R")
```

### Option C: Manual Package Specification
```r
rsconnect::deployApp(
  appDir = getwd(),
  appPrimaryDoc = "app.R",
  appName = "exposure-model",
  forceUpdate = TRUE,
  lint = FALSE,  # Skip linting
  launch.browser = TRUE
)
```

## üìû Get Help

If deployment still fails after trying all above:

1. **Copy the FULL error message** from R console
2. **Screenshot the Posit Connect error** page
3. **Check these logs:**
   - R Console output
   - Posit Connect Cloud ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Logs
4. **Post to community:** https://community.rstudio.com/

## ‚ú® Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when you see:

```
‚úì Deployment completed successfully!
‚úì Opening in browser...
```

And your app loads in the browser with:
- ‚úÖ Kenbright logo visible
- ‚úÖ Sidebar menu working
- ‚úÖ All tabs accessible
- ‚úÖ Upload functionality working
